# GCDOC Portal

This is my app to deal with dog club stuff. I'll be working on improvements until I can use it as a full fledged system. This README will serve as my list of action items and Roadmap for improvements.

## Bug Fixes & QOL Improvements
- DONE: address and phone aren't updating when Rachel goes to edit them. 
- DONE: export to CSV of both members and work credits and import from those backup files
- DONE: separate out the stuff in App.jsx into individual modules, it's a bit long and Gemini doesn't work well in long files. 
- DONE: Add an Admin Review panel for pending hours
- DONE: Add a check on pending values and approve them if they are less than 8, even if they were pending before
- DONE: Add a check to force all values to pending where daily hours > 8 
- Need a way to just take more pictures vs. X ing out
- Need a todo/doing/done type thing on the sheet archives
- Would like a link on the hours where the hours are linked to a sheet
- would like a better search for the members on the hours entry
- Put in dues calculations
- put in a double checkmark
- ETL plugin for wordpress to sync to WP platform
