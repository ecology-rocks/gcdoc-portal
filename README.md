# GCDOC Portal

This is my app to deal with dog club stuff. I'll be working on improvements until I can use it as a full fledged system. This README will serve as my list of action items and Roadmap for improvements.

## Bug Fixes
- address and phone aren't updating when Rachel goes to edit them. 

## QOL Improvements
- DONE: export to CSV of both members and work credits and import from those backup files
- DONE: separate out the stuff in App.jsx into individual modules, it's a bit long and Gemini doesn't work well in long files.
